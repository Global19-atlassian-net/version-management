## Node.js Version Management Discussion Group

This repo and discussion group is to facilitate collaboration amongst
maintainers and stakeholders for Node version and runtime configuration managers.
Its purpose is to arrive at recommendations and a roadmap for version
management under the auspices of Node.js core and the Node.js Foundation, per
request of the Node.js TSC in its Nov-3-2016 meeting.

The TSC has asked for these at their next meeting, Nov-17-2016.

[Initial Proposal](./initial_proposal.md) provides an initial description of
the benefits improved version management will bring to Node's users and why
this would be most successful if closely aligned with the runtime itself
here in the Node Foundation.
